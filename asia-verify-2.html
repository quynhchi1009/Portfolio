          As Lead Product Designer at AsiaVerify, I transformed complex
          compliance data into clear, intuitive experiences. I spearheaded the
          creation of AsiaVerify’s first comprehensive design system, ensuring
          consistency and scalability across platforms. <br />
          Collaborating closely with engineers, I designed and refined
          user-friendly UI/UX, conducted usability testing, and optimized data
          visualization to simplify regulatory workflows. Partnering with
          Project Manager Joanne NG and Designer Celine Ong, I developed
          frameworks and prototypes that aligned the team around a bold design
          vision—streamlining decision-making and enhancing the platform’s
          impact.

        <h2 class="text-container__headline">Overview</h2>
        <p class="text-container__description">
          Clients often ask the product design team, “How can we streamline the
          Billing and Subscription dashboard and simplify the user journey?” In
          response, we focused on showcasing AsiaVerify’s unique strengths and
          positioning it as a leading platform for reliable data generation. Our
          primary goal was to develop a clean, user-friendly subscription
          interface that elevates usability and highlights critical information.
          Guided by user research, data insights, and thoughtful critique, we
          identified core challenges that impact millions of users worldwide and
          crafted solutions to address their most pressing needs.

        <h2 class="text-container__headline">Background & Challenges</h2>
        <p class="text-container__description">
          The legacy dashboard struggled with conveying distinct subscription
          states, often leaving users confused about critical details such as
          renewal dates, billing cycles, and available balances. Key challenges
          included:<br />
          <span class="bold">Cluttered Information:</span> Users found it
          difficult to quickly extract important data due to inconsistent
          presentation of subscription details and usage metrics.<br />
          <span class="bold">Inconsistent Messaging:</span> Differing
          subscription states (active/upgraded, exhausted balances, cancelled
          subscriptions) were not clearly distinguished, leading to
          misunderstandings about current account status and next steps.<br />
          <span class="bold">Delayed Feedback:</span> Users experienced
          frustration from slow or unclear updates following billing events,
          resulting in increased support queries.<br />
          <span class="bold">Adaptability Issues:</span> The interface needed to
          dynamically adjust content based on subscription type, whether annual
          or monthly, and the unique status of each user, from active engagement
          to cancellation scenarios.

          UX Research
        </h3>
        <p class="text-container__description">
          To uncover the core challenges and opportunities for improvement on
          the Subscription dashboard, we conducted a comprehensive user research
          study. We gathered feedback by directly asking users about their
          experiences and challenges with the current dashboard, then organized
          the findings by severity to identify the most pressing issues.
        </p>
        <p class="text-container__description">
          <span class="bold">User Interviews:</span> We engaged directly with
          users to gather insights on their experiences with the current
          Subscription dashboard. Feedback revealed that users struggled with
          locating renewal dates, understanding plan features, and interpreting
          messages related to exhausted balances or cancellation.
          <br />
          <span class="bold">Customer Support Data:</span> We reviewed customer
          support tickets to identify common billing-related issues. This
          analysis revealed recurring complaints about surprise charges and
          missed renewal notifications, highlighting critical pain points in the
          user journey.
          <br />
          <span class="bold">Heuristic Evaluation:</span> We conducted a
          usability audit based on Nielsen’s Heuristics, which uncovered
          significant issues with system status visibility, error prevention,
          and overall consistency in the dashboard design.<br />
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-container__subheadline text-dark-gray mt-5">
          Key Insights
        </h3>
        <p class="text-container__description">
          These insights underscored the necessity of an interface that not only
          provides real-time updates and clear navigation but also delivers
          personalized content that aligns with the specific subscription status
          of each user.
        </p>
        <p class="text-container__description">
          <span class="bold">Visibility of System Status:</span> Users need an
          immediate, clear snapshot of their current plan, billing cycle, and
          remaining balance.<br />
          <span class="bold">Guided Actions:</span> There is a strong desire for
          streamlined actions that allow users to quickly top up or upgrade
          their subscriptions without navigating through multiple pages.<br />
          <span class="bold">Clear Hierarchy:</span> Critical subscription
          details—such as plan cost, next billing date, and subscription
          expiry—must be prominently displayed to reduce user confusion. <br />
          <span class="bold">Accessible Interactions:</span> Current design
          elements, such as contrast levels and text sizes, are insufficient for
          some users, emphasizing the need for design adjustments that meet WCAG
          guidelines.

        <h2 class="text-container__headline">Active User Journey</h2>
        <p class="text-container__description">
          To design a more intuitive Subscription dashboard, we mapped out the
          entire user journey to understand every interaction point and identify
          potential friction areas. This detailed analysis enabled us to align
          design decisions with user needs and ensure that each step of the
          billing process is both seamless and efficient.

          Mapping the workflow
        </h3>
        <p class="text-container__description">
          <span class="bold">Entry Point: </span>Once a payment is successfully
          processed, users are immediately redirected to the “My Plan Dashboard”
          with the Subscription History tab open by default, ensuring they are
          presented with the most relevant information right away.
          <br />
          <span class="bold">Primary Goal:</span> The main objective for users
          is to quickly and clearly view their current subscription status. This
          includes details such as their active plan, remaining balance, and the
          next billing or renewal date.<br />
          <span class="bold">Secondary Goals:</span> Beyond checking their
          status, users often need to update payment information, review
          historical billing data, or contact support for issues or
          clarifications.<br />
          <span class="bold">Pain Points & Opportunities: </span>

        <ul>

            plan features.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cluttered Presentation: Critical information was often lost in a
            lack of clear visual hierarchy, making it hard to digest at a glance
          </li>
          <li>
            Actionable Shortcuts: There is a need for streamlined processes that
            allow users to top-up or upgrade subscriptions without navigating
            through multiple pages.

          Applying Gestalt and Usability Principles
        </h2>
        <p class="text-container__description">
          We applied core Gestalt and usability principles to design a dashboard
          that is both visually coherent and functionally efficient, ensuring a
          personalized experience for both active and upgraded users. Drawing on
          our design documentation, we structured the “My Plan Dashboard” to
          adapt seamlessly to various subscription types while maintaining
          consistency and clarity across all elements.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Adaptive Information Hierarchy:</span> By
            leveraging proximity and similarity, we grouped related
            elements—such as the Subscription Plan Breakdown, Balances Usage
            Tracker, and Subscription Expiry Tracker—so users can immediately
            grasp key information about their current plan. For example,
            essential details like the billing cycle, next billing date, and
            auto-renewal information are clearly delineated, reducing cognitive
            load and guiding users toward appropriate actions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Consistent Visual Structure:</span> A consistent
            design language was established across the dashboard. Uniform
            typography, color coding (green for >50%, orange for 25-50%, and red
            for 0-24% thresholds), and iconography create an intuitive
            interface. This consistency not only reinforces the brand identity
            but also enables users to easily interpret complex data—whether
            they're reviewing their subscription plan or tracking usage and
            expiry details.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Seamless Navigation and Flow:</span> The layout
            supports a logical progression of tasks. Upon successful payment,
            users are redirected to the “My Plan Dashboard” with the
            Subscription History tab open by default. This intentional design
            choice, combined with clearly defined filters, sorting options, and
            navigational elements (such as pagination and refresh buttons),
            ensures that users can effortlessly move between sections like
            Subscription History and Usage History, minimizing friction and
            improving overall efficiency.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold"
              >Dynamic Feedback and Interactive Affordance:</span
            >
            Real-time updates and clear visual cues are integral to the
            dashboard’s design. Trackers update immediately when a report is
            generated or a billing event occurs, providing instant feedback.
            Visual indicators—such as green dots for newly updated rows and
            tooltips on trackers—offer context-sensitive information, helping
            users understand their current status and available actions without
            delay.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Accessibility and Error Prevention:</span>
            Emphasis on accessible design is evident through high-contrast color
            schemes, legible typography, and comprehensive tooltips. These
            elements, along with error prevention strategies like intuitive
            sorting options and the inclusion of a dedicated support CTA, ensure
            that users of all abilities can navigate the dashboard with ease and
            confidence.
          </li>
        </ul>
        By applying these Gestalt and usability principles, we crafted a “My
        Plan Dashboard” that not only presents comprehensive subscription
        details in an organized manner but also provides a responsive,
        user-friendly experience tailored to the needs of both active and
        upgraded users.
