          As the Brand & Marketing Designer at Me3, I led the visual and graphic
          design strategy across all touchpoints. I was responsible for crafting
          compelling pitch decks, legal documents, and interactive marketing
          materials, ensuring brand consistency and clarity. My work spanned
          across marketing videos, organic social media, educational article
          webpages, marketplace ads, and internal events—driving engagement and
          brand recognition. Additionally, I played a key role in creative

          Shaping the Visual Identity of $ME3
        </h3>
        <p class="text-container__description">
          As the lead designer for the $ME3 project, I played a key role in
          crafting a cohesive and compelling visual narrative across all
          investor materials and marketing assets.<hr />
          I designed and developed
          <span class="bold">
            investor decks, pitch presentations, workshop materials, and product
            showcases,
          </span>
          collaborating closely with copywriters to ensure clarity and impact.
          My work extended to
          <span class="bold">
            PR images, article web flows, infographics, emails, banners, social
            media content, website visuals, and documentation articles,
          </span>
          creating a unified brand presence across multiple channels.<hr />
          A major achievement was leading the design of
          <span class="bold">500+ slides</span> in collaboration with product
          managers. I focused on
          <span class="bold">
            layout optimization, hierarchy, and visual storytelling
          </span>
          , incorporating feedback on legibility and legal compliance during
          design critiques. The final decks featured
          <span class="bold"
            >refined key elements, optimized graphs, and clear color
            categorization</span
          >, making complex information more digestible for stakeholders.<hr/> Beyond
          presentations, I also developed <span class="bold">mood boards, working plans, customer
          journey maps, and user flows</span>, shaping the overall design direction
          through early-stage wireframing and concept development. This
          structured approach resulted in decks that effectively balanced $ME3’s
          business goals with user needs, ensuring clarity, engagement, and
          strategic alignment.
