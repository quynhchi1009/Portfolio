        During my time at KPMG ITS GmbH, I worked as both an intern and a working student on the Web Development team, contributing to UI/UX design for over 10 client websites and applications.<br/>
        In my 6-month winter internship, I simultaneously worked on multiple projects, including the design of a retail management platform that enabled home buyers to explore virtual facilities and engage in interactive experiences. To optimize the user journey, I conducted in-depth research on real estate applications, applied design thinking methodologies, and developed prototypes to enhance engagement. This experience deepened my understanding of UX flows in live projects and strengthened my ability to design and manage complex platforms effectively.

        The commercial real estate investment landscape lacks efficient digital platforms for connecting investors with property opportunities. Real Estate Management Site aimed to streamline this process by creating a centralized platform where investors could discover, evaluate, and manage real estate investments. Our solution introduced an intuitive interface that simplified complex property data visualization while maintaining the professional standards required in commercial real estate.</p>
